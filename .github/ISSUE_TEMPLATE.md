This library attempts to be as stable as possible so features have to meet a
high bar to be added. This library also prefers interoperability with other
libraries over continuous additions. Here are some tips to get your feature added:

 * Search existing issues and pull requests first.
 * Send a Pull Request! Start with API design and post for review early.
