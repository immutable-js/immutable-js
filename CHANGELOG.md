### Changed

### [Minor BC break] Reducing file size / tree shaking

Immutable does not export a default object containing all it's API anymore.
It changes the output of your JS file if you use a bundler that supports tree-shaking (all modern bundler do).
As a drawback, you can not `immport Immutable` directly:

```diff
- import Immutable from 'immutable';
+ import { List, Map } from 'immutable';

- const l = Immutable.List([Immutable.Map({ a: 'A' })]);
+ const l = List([Map({ a: 'A' })]);
```

If you want the non-recommanded, but shorter migration path, you can do this:

```diff
- import Immutable from 'immutable';
+ import * as Immutable from 'immutable';

  const l = Immutable.List([Immutable.Map({ a: 'A' })]);
```

### [TypeScript Break] Improve TypeScript definition for `Map`

> If you do use TypeScript, then this change does not impact you : no runtime change here.
> But if you use Map with TypeScript, this is a HUGE change !

Imagine the following code

```ts
const m = Map({ length: 3, 1: 'one' });
```

This was previously typed as `Map<string, string | number>`

and return type of `m.get('length')` or `m.get('inexistant')` was typed as `string | number | undefined`.

This made `Map` really unusable with TypeScript.

Now the Map is typed like this:

```ts
MapOf<{
    length: number;
    1: string;
}>
```

and the return type of `m.get('length')` is typed as `number`.

The return of `m.get('inexistant')` throw the TypeScript error:

> Argument of type '"inexistant"' is not assignable to parameter of type '1 | "length"

#### If you want to keep the old definition

**This is a minor BC for TS users**, so if you want to keep the old definition, you can declare you Map like this:

```ts
const m = Map<string, string | number>({ length: 3, 1: 'one' });
```

#### If you need to type the Map with a larger definition

You might want to declare a wider definition, you can type your Map like this:

```ts
type MyMapType = {
  length: number;
  1: string | null;
  optionalProperty?: string;
};
const m = Map<MyMapType>({ length: 3, 1: 'one' });
```

Keep in mind that the `MapOf` will try to be consistant with the simple TypeScript object, so you can not do this:

```ts
Map({ a: 'a' }).set('b', 'b');
Map({ a: 'a' }).delete('a');
```

Like a simple object, it will only work if the type is forced:

```ts
Map<{ a: string; b?: string }>({ a: 'a' }).set('b', 'b'); // b is forced in type and optional
Map<{ a?: string }>({ a: 'a' }).delete('a'); // you can only delete an optional key
```

#### Are all `Map` methods implemented ?

For now, only `get`, `getIn`, `set`, `update`, `delete`, `remove`, `toJS`, `toJSON` methods are implemented. All other methods will fallback to the basic `Map` definition. Other method definition will be added later, but as some might be really complex, we prefer the progressive enhancement on the most used functions.

### Note for users of v4.0.0-rc.12

There were mostly bugfixes and improvements since RC 12. Upgrading should be painless for most users.
However, there is **one breaking change**: The behavior of `merge` and `mergeDeep` has changed. See below for details.

### BREAKING

#### [merge()](<https://immutable-js.com/docs/latest@main/merge()/>)

- No longer use value-equality within `merge()` ([#1391](https://github.com/immutable-js/immutable-js/pull/1391))

  > This rectifies an inconsistent behavior between `x.merge(y)` and `x.mergeDeep(y)` where merge would
  > use `===` on leaf values to determine return-self optimizations, while mergeDeep would use `is()`.
  > This improves consistency across the library and avoids a possible performance pitfall.

- No longer deeply coerce argument to merge() ([#1339](https://github.com/immutable-js/immutable-js/pull/1339))
  > Previously, the argument provided to `merge()` was deeply converted to Immutable collections via `fromJS()`.
  > This was the only function in the library which calls `fromJS()` indirectly,
  > and it was surprising and made it difficult to understand what the result of `merge()` would be.
  > Now, the value provided to `merge()` is only shallowly converted to an Immutable collection, similar to
  > related methods in the library. This may change the behavior of your calls to `merge()`.

#### [mergeDeep()](<https://immutable-js.com/docs/latest@main/mergeDeep()/>)

- Replace incompatible collections when merging nested data ([#1840](https://github.com/immutable-js/immutable-js/pull/1840))

  > It will no longer merge lists of tuples into maps. For more information see
  > [#1840](https://github.com/immutable-js/immutable-js/pull/1840) and the updated `mergeDeep()` documentation.

- Concat Lists when merging deeply ([#1344](https://github.com/immutable-js/immutable-js/pull/1344))
  > Previously, calling `map.mergeDeep()` with a value containing a `List` would replace the values in the
  > original List. This has always been confusing, and does not properly treat `List` as a monoid.
  > Now, `List.merge` is simply an alias for `List.concat`, and `map.mergeDeep()` will concatenate deeply-found lists
  > instead of replacing them.

#### [Seq](https://immutable-js.com/docs/latest@main/Seq/)

- Remove IteratorSequence. Do not attempt to detect iterators in `Seq()`. ([#1589](https://github.com/immutable-js/immutable-js/pull/1589))

  > Iterables can still be provided to `Seq()`, and _most_ Iterators are also
  > Iterables, so this change should not affect the vast majority of uses.
  > For more information, see PR #1589

- Remove `Seq.of()` (#1311, #1310)
  > This method has been removed since it cannot be correctly typed. It's recommended to convert
  > `Seq.of(1, 2, 3)` to `Seq([1, 2, 3])`.

#### [isImmutable()](<https://immutable-js.com/docs/latest@main/isImmutable()/>)

- `isImmutable()` now returns true for collections currently within a `withMutations()` call. ([#1374](https://github.com/immutable-js/immutable-js/pull/1374))

  > Previously, `isImmutable()` did double-duty of both determining if a value was a Collection or Record
  > from this library as well as if it was outside a `withMutations()` call.
  > This latter case caused confusion and was rarely used.

#### [toArray()](<https://immutable-js.com/docs/latest@main/Collection.Keyed#toArray()>)

- KeyedCollection.toArray() returns array of tuples. ([#1340](https://github.com/immutable-js/immutable-js/pull/1340))

  > Previously, calling `toArray()` on a keyed collection (incl `Map` and `OrderedMap`) would
  > discard keys and return an Array of values. This has always been confusing, and differs from `Array.from()`.
  > Now, calling `toArray()` on a keyed collection will return an Array of `[key, value]` tuples, matching
  > the behavior of `Array.from()`.

#### [concat()](<https://immutable-js.com/docs/latest@main/List/#concat()>)

- `list.concat()` now has a slightly more efficient implementation and `map.concat()` is an alias for `map.merge()`. ([#1373](https://github.com/immutable-js/immutable-js/pull/1373))

  > In rare cases, this may affect use of `map.concat()` which expected slightly different behavior from `map.merge()`.

#### [Collection](https://immutable-js.com/docs/latest@main/Collection/), formerly `Iterable`

- The `Iterable` class has been renamed to `Collection`, and `isIterable()` has been renamed to `isCollection()`.
  Aliases with the existing names exist to make transitioning code easier.

#### [Record](https://immutable-js.com/docs/latest@main/Record/)

- Record is no longer an Immutable Collection type.
  - Now `isCollection(myRecord)` returns `false` instead of `true`.
  - The sequence API (such as `map`, `filter`, `forEach`) no longer exist on Records.
  - `delete()` and `clear()` no longer exist on Records.

#### Other breaking changes

- **Potentially Breaking:** Improve hash speed and avoid collision for common values ([#1629](https://github.com/immutable-js/immutable-js/pull/1629))

  > Causes some hash values to change, which could impact the order of iteration of values in some Maps
  > (which are already advertised as unordered, but highlighting just to be safe)

- Node buffers no longer considered value-equal ([#1437](https://github.com/immutable-js/immutable-js/pull/1437))

- Plain Objects and Arrays are no longer considered opaque values ([#1369](https://github.com/immutable-js/immutable-js/pull/1369))

  > This changes the behavior of a few common methods with respect to plain Objects and Arrays where these were
  > previously considered opaque to `merge()` and `setIn()`, they now are treated as collections and can be merged
  > into and updated (persistently). This offers an exciting alternative to small Lists and Records.

- The "predicate" functions, `isCollection`, `isKeyed`, `isIndexed`, `isAssociative` have been moved from `Iterable.` to the top level exports.

- The `toJSON()` method performs a shallow conversion (previously it was an alias for `toJS()`, which remains a deep conversion).

- Some minor implementation details have changed, which may require updates to libraries which deeply integrate with Immutable.js's private APIs.

- The Cursor API is officially deprecated. Use [immutable-cursor](https://github.com/redbadger/immutable-cursor) instead.

- **Potentially Breaking:** [TypeScript] Remove `Iterable<T>` as tuple from Map constructor types ([#1626](https://github.com/immutable-js/immutable-js/pull/1626))
  > Typescript allowed constructing a Map with a list of List instances, assuming each was a key, value pair.
  > While this runtime behavior still works, this type led to more issues than it solved, so it has been removed.
  > (Note, this may break previous v4 rcs, but is not a change against v3)

  > `isSeq()`, `isList()`, `isMap()`, `isOrderedMap()`, `isStack()`, `isSet()`, `isOrderedSet()`, and `isRecord()`.

- Improve performance of toJS ([#1581](https://github.com/immutable-js/immutable-js/pull/1581))

  > Cursory test is >10% faster than both v3.8.2 and v4.0.0-rc.7,
  > and corrects the regression since v4.0.0-rc.9.

- A new predicate function `isValueObject()` helps to detect objects which implement `equals()` and `hashCode()`,
  and type definitions now define the interface `ValueObject` which you can implement in your own code to create objects which
  behave as values and can be keys in Maps or entries in Sets.

- Using `fromJS()` with a "reviver" function now provides access to the key path to each translated value. ([#1118](https://github.com/immutable-js/immutable-js/pull/1118))
