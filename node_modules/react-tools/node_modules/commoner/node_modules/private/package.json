In other words, you don't have to worry about memory leaks.*\n\n**Create a unique property name that cannot be enumerated or guessed:**\n```js\nvar secretKey = require(\"private\").makeUniqueKey();\nvar obj = Object.create(null); // any kind of object works\n\nObject.defineProperty(obj, secretKey, {\n  value: { totallySafeProperty: \"p455w0rd\" },\n  enumerable: false // optional; non-enumerability is the default\n});\n\nObject.defineProperty(obj, \"nonEnumerableProperty\", {\n  value: \"anyone can guess my name\",\n  enumerable: false\n});\n\nconsole.log(obj[secretKey].totallySafeProperty); // p455w0rd\nconsole.log(obj.nonEnumerableProperty); // \"anyone can guess my name\"\nconsole.log(Object.keys(obj)); // []\nconsole.log(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj)); // [\"nonEnumerableProperty\"]\n\nfor (var key in obj) {\n  console.log(key); // never called\n}\n```\nBecause these keys are non-enumerable, you can't discover them using a `for`-`in` loop. Because `secretKey` is a long string of random characters, you would have a lot of trouble guessing it. And because the `private` module wraps `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` to exclude the keys it generates, you can't even use that interface to discover it.\n\nUnless you have access to the value of the `secretKey` property name, there is no way to access the value associated with it. So your only responsibility as secret-keeper is to avoid handing out the value of `secretKey` to untrusted code.\n\nThink of this style as a home-grown version of the first style. Note, however, that it requires a full implementation of ES5's `Object.defineProperty` method in order to make any safety guarantees, whereas the first example will provide safety even in environments that do not support `Object.defineProperty`.\n\nRationale\n---\n\nIn JavaScript, the only data that are truly private are local variables\nwhose values do not *leak* from the scope in which they were defined.\n\nThis notion of *closure privacy* is powerful, and it readily provides some\nof the benefits of traditional data privacy, a la Java or C++:\n```js\nfunction MyClass(secret) {\n    this.increment = function() {\n        return ++secret;\n    };\n}\n\nvar mc = new MyClass(3);\nconsole.log(mc.increment()); // 4\n```\nYou can learn something about `secret` by calling `.increment()`, and you\ncan increase its value by one as many times as you like, but you can never\ndecrease its value, because it is completely inaccessible except through\nthe `.increment` method. And if the `.increment` method were not\navailable, it would be as if no `secret` variable had ever been declared,\nas far as you could tell.\n\nThis style breaks down as soon as you want to inherit methods from the\nprototype of a class:\n```js\nfunction MyClass(secret) {\n    this.secret = secret;\n}\n\nMyClass.prototype.increment = function() {\n    return ++this.secret;\n};\n```\nThe only way to communicate between the `MyClass` constructor and the\n`.increment` method in this example is to manipulate shared properties of\n`this`. Unfortunately `this.secret` is now exposed to unlicensed\nmodification:\n```js\nvar mc = new MyClass(6);\nconsole.log(mc.increment()); // 7\nmc.secret -= Infinity;\nconsole.log(mc.increment()); // -Infinity\nmc.secret = \"Go home JavaScript, you're drunk.\";\nmc.increment(); // NaN\n```\nAnother problem with closure privacy is that it only lends itself to\nper-instance privacy, whereas the `private` keyword in most\nobject-oriented languages indicates that the data member in question is\nvisible to all instances of the same class.\n\nSuppose you have a `Node` class with a notion of parents and children:\n```js\nfunction Node() {\n    var parent;\n    var children = [];\n\n    this.getParent = function() {\n        return parent;\n    };\n\n    this.appendChild = function(child) {\n        children.push(child);\n        child.parent = this; // Can this be made to work?\n    };\n}\n```\nThe desire here is to allow other `Node` objects to manipulate the value\nreturned by `.getParent()`, but otherwise disallow any modification of the\n`parent` variable. You could expose a `.setParent` function, but then\nanyone could call it, and you might as well give up on the getter/setter\npattern.\n\nThis module solves both of these problems.\n\nUsage\n---\n\nLet's revisit the `Node` example from above:\n```js\nvar p = require(\"private\").makeAccessor();\n\nfunction Node() {\n    var privates = p(this);\n    var children = [];\n\n    this.getParent = function() {\n        return privates.parent;\n    };\n\n    this.appendChild = function(child) {\n        children.push(child);\n        var cp = p(child);\n        if (cp.parent)\n            cp.parent.removeChild(child);\n        cp.parent = this;\n        return child;\n    };\n}\n```\nNow, in order to access the private data of a `Node` object, you need to\nhave access to the unique `p` function that is being used here.  This is\nalready an improvement over the previous example, because it allows\nrestricted access by other `Node` instances, but can it help with the\n`Node.prototype` problem too?\n\nYes it can!\n```js\nvar p = require(\"private\").makeAccessor();\n\nfunction Node() {\n    p(this).children = [];\n}\n\nvar Np = Node.prototype;\n\nNp.getParent = function() {\n    return p(this).parent;\n};\n\nNp.appendChild = function(child) {\n    p(this).children.push(child);\n    var cp = p(child);\n    if (cp.parent)\n        cp.parent.removeChild(child);\n    cp.parent = this;\n    return child;\n};\n```\nBecause `p` is in scope not only within the `Node` constructor but also\nwithin `Node` methods, we can finally avoid redefining methods every time\nthe `Node` constructor is called.\n\nNow, you might be wondering how you can restrict access to `p` so that no\nuntrusted code is able to call it. The answer is to use your favorite\nmodule pattern, be it CommonJS, AMD `define`, or even the old\nImmediately-Invoked Function Expression:\n```js\nvar Node = (function() {\n    var p = require(\"private\").makeAccessor();\n\n    function Node() {\n        p(this).children = [];\n    }\n\n    var Np = Node.prototype;\n\n    Np.getParent = function() {\n        return p(this).parent;\n    };\n\n    Np.appendChild = function(child) {\n        p(this).children.push(child);\n        var cp = p(child);\n        if (cp.parent)\n            cp.parent.removeChild(child);\n        cp.parent = this;\n        return child;\n    };\n\n    return Node;\n}());\n\nvar parent = new Node;\nvar child = new Node;\nparent.appendChild(child);\nassert.strictEqual(child.getParent(), parent);\n```\nBecause this version of `p` never leaks from the enclosing function scope,\nonly `Node` objects have access to it.\n\nSo, you see, the claim I made at the beginning of this README remains\ntrue:\n\n> In JavaScript, the only data that are truly private are local variables\n> whose values do not *leak* from the scope in which they were defined.\n\nIt just so happens that closure privacy is sufficient to implement a\nprivacy model similar to that provided by other languages.\n",
