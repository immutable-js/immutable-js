# mergeDeepWith()

Like[`mergeDeep()`](<../mergeDeep()>), but when two non-collections or incompatible
collections are encountered at the same key, it uses the `merger` function
to determine the resulting value. Collections are considered incompatible
if they fall into separate categories between keyed, indexed, and set-like.

<Signature
  code={`mergeDeepWith(
    merger: (oldVal, newVal, key) => any,
    collection,
    ...collections
  )`}
/>

A functional alternative to `collection.mergeDeepWith()` which will also
work with plain Objects and Arrays.

<Repl
  defaultValue={`List([1, 2, 3])
`}
/>

// TODO this should be in the repl but it does have an error

```js
const original = { x: { y: 123 } };

mergeDeepWith(
  (oldVal, newVal) => oldVal + newVal,
  original,
  { x: { y: 456 }
);
```
